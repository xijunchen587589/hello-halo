  'IMPORTANT: WebFetch WILL FAIL for authenticated or private URLs. Before using this tool, ' +
  'check if the URL points to an authenticated service (e.g. Google Docs, Confluence, Jira, GitHub). ' +
  'If so, look for a specialized MCP tool that provides authenticated access.\n\n' +
  '- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model\n' +
  '- Takes a URL and a prompt as input\n' +
  '- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown\n' +
  '- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model\n' +
  '- Returns the model\'s response about the content\n' +
  '- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content\n\n' +
  'Usage notes:\n' +
  '  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions.\n' +
  '  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL\n' +
  '  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS\n' +
  '  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page\n' +
  '  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files\n' +
  '  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large\n' +
  '  - Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL\n' +
  '  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.\n' +
  '  - For GitHub URLs, prefer using the gh CLI via Bash instead (e.g., gh pr view, gh issue view, gh api).';
