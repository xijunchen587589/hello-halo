/**
 * Codex app-server capability descriptor.
 *
 * Reflects the actual V2 protocol surface Halo consumes via JSON-RPC over
 * stdio. Differences from CC that the renderer must adapt to:
 *
 *   - tool input arrives as a single payload (no `input_json_delta` stream).
 *   - todos are 2-state (pending/completed), no `activeForm`.
 *   - sub-agents are imperative (Codex orchestrates internally; Halo only
 *     sees a flat tool stream), so the SubAgentTimeline UI collapses.
 *   - `Edit`/`Write` tool calls are synthesized from the engine's
 *     `file_change` item, with patch fidelity. Marked lossy because
 *     line-level oldString/newString reconstruction is not always
 *     available — the diff renderer falls back to a unified patch view.
 *
 * Anything the engine genuinely supports natively (stream text/reasoning
 * tokens, real-time shell stdout, MCP, session resume via `thread/resume`,
 * multimodal images, interrupt, AskUserQuestion via elicitation bridge,
 * thread compaction) is advertised as supported here.
