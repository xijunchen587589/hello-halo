## 1. Module Role

Core glue layer that connects all platform modules and the existing Agent service
to provide App execution capabilities. This is the **only module** that crosses
layer boundaries (apps/ → platform/ → services/).

Responsibilities:
- Translate App subscriptions into scheduler jobs + event-bus subscriptions
- Execute App runs: create Agent session → inject prompt/tools → process results
- Manage the Activity Layer (automation_runs + activity_entries)
- Provide `report_to_user` MCP tool for AI-to-user communication
- Handle escalation lifecycle (waiting_user → user responds → new run with context)
- Enforce concurrency limits (global maxConcurrentRuns)

Does NOT:
- Install/configure Apps (that's apps/manager)
- Implement scheduling algorithms (that's platform/scheduler)
- Filter events (that's platform/event-bus)
- Directly operate AI Browser DOM (AI does that via MCP tools + Task tool)

## 2. Key Design Decisions

### 2.1 Own SDK Sessions (No sendMessage Modification)

**Decision**: Runtime creates its own V2 sessions using `unstable_v2_createSession`
directly, rather than modifying the existing `sendMessage()` in `services/agent/`.

**Rationale**:
- `sendMessage()` is 946 lines of complex code tightly coupled to conversation UI
  (mainWindow IPC, thought accumulation, streaming display, conversation persistence).
- Runtime's execution needs are fundamentally different: no UI streaming, no
  conversation persistence, different MCP tool set, different error handling.
- Modifying sendMessage risks breaking the core conversation flow.
- Runtime imports helper functions (`getApiCredentials`, `resolveCredentialsForSdk`,
  `buildBaseSdkOptions`, `getHeadlessElectronPath`) from the agent service but
  manages its own session lifecycle independently.

**Trade-off**: Some code duplication in stream processing. Acceptable because the
runtime's stream processing is much simpler (no thought accumulation, no UI events).

### 2.2 Stateless Runs (No Cross-Run Session Persistence)

**Decision**: Each run creates a fresh V2 session. Sessions are closed after
the run completes. No session reuse across runs.

**Rationale**:
- Conversation sessions benefit from reuse (user expects continuity within a chat).
- Automation runs are independent executions. Each should start clean.
- Keeping sessions alive for 24h (escalation wait) wastes resources and is fragile.
- The memory system provides continuity: AI reads memory at start, writes at end.
- Escalation responses trigger a NEW run with the escalation context injected into
  the initial message, not a session resume. This is simpler and more robust.

### 2.3 Escalation as Run Boundary

**Decision**: When AI calls `report_to_user(type="escalation")`, the current run
records the escalation and ends. User response triggers a new run.

**Rationale**:
- Holding a Claude Code subprocess alive for hours is resource-wasteful and fragile.
- The AI can write important context to memory before escalating.
- The new run receives: escalation question + user response + memory context.
- This is simpler than session hibernation and more resilient to process crashes.
- V2 could introduce session persistence if needed, but V1 prioritizes robustness.

### 2.4 report_to_user as SDK MCP Server

**Decision**: `report_to_user` is implemented as an SDK MCP server using
`tool()` + `createSdkMcpServer()`, same pattern as `platform/memory/tools.ts`
and `services/ai-browser/sdk-mcp-server.ts`.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing Halo patterns for injecting custom tools.
- SDK MCP servers are first-class citizens in V2 sessions.
- The tool handler has direct access to the Activity store (closure capture).

### 2.5 Activity Layer in SQLite

**Decision**: `automation_runs` and `activity_entries` tables in the app-level
SQLite database, with FOREIGN KEY to `installed_apps` with CASCADE DELETE.

**Rationale**:
- Structured data enables querying (by app, by type, by time range).
- FK CASCADE ensures cleanup when an App is uninstalled.
- Matches the architecture doc's schema design exactly.

### 2.6 Concurrency: Simple Counting Semaphore

**Decision**: Module-level counting semaphore with configurable `maxConcurrent`.
Default: 2 concurrent runs.

**Rationale**:
- Each run spawns a Claude Code subprocess (significant resource usage).
- Simple acquire/release pattern. Callers that can't acquire are queued.
- No priority system in V1 (FIFO queue).
- The AI Browser lane (maxConcurrentAIBrowserRuns) is deferred to V2.

### 2.7 Activation Lifecycle

**Decision**: `activate(appId)` is idempotent. It reads the App's subscriptions,
creates scheduler jobs (for schedule-type) and event-bus subscriptions (for other
types), and registers a keep-alive reason.

`deactivate(appId)` removes all scheduler jobs and event-bus subscriptions for
the App and unregisters the keep-alive reason.

**State tracking**: An internal `Map<appId, ActivationState>` tracks the
scheduler job IDs, event-bus unsubscribe functions, and keep-alive disposer for
each activated App.

### 2.8 Trigger Context in Initial Message

**Decision**: The initial message sent to the Agent includes structured trigger
context (what triggered this run, when, user config values).

**Rationale**:
- The AI needs to know WHY it was triggered to decide what to do.
- For schedule triggers: "Scheduled run at 2026-02-21 14:30 (every 30m)"
- For event triggers: "Triggered by file change: /path/to/file"
- For escalation follow-ups: includes the original question + user's response
- User config values are included so the AI can use them (e.g., product URLs).

### 2.9 No IPC/HTTP Routes in This Module

**Decision**: Runtime module exposes only a TypeScript service interface.
IPC handlers and HTTP routes are a separate concern (Phase 3 task ⑫).

**Rationale**:
- Keeps the module focused on business logic.
- IPC/HTTP layer is thin routing that delegates to the service.
- Can be added independently without modifying runtime internals.

### 2.10 Stream Processing: Collect Final Result Only

**Decision**: Runtime's stream processing collects the final text result and
token usage but does NOT stream individual events to the renderer.

**Rationale**:
- Activity Thread shows summaries, not real-time AI thinking.
- The AI communicates results via `report_to_user` tool calls.
- Full execution details are available via "View Process" (session logs).
- This dramatically simplifies stream processing vs. conversation mode.

### 2.11 Auto-Continue on Missing report_to_user

**Decision**: `report_to_user` is the definitive completion signal for
automation runs. If the LLM ends a turn without calling it (and no SDK error
occurred), the runtime automatically sends a follow-up message prompting the
AI to continue — up to `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUES` (10) times. If all auto-retries
are exhausted the run is marked as `error`, and the user may manually resume
via the "Continue" button (in the Activity Thread or Session Detail view).

**Auto-continue loop**:
- Each retry sends a single unified message: `"Continue. " + AUTO_CONTINUE_MESSAGE`
  (no graduated messaging — one clear, consistent reminder).
- `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUES = 10` (was 3). Raised to tolerate longer periods of
  context pressure or transient backend issues without user intervention.
- After all retries: the run's `sessionId` is persisted on the DB record so the
  session can be restored on user-initiated continue.

**User-initiated continue** (`trigger_type = 'continue_followup'`):
- Triggered by the "Continue" button on `run_error` activity entries where
  `content.error === 'report_to_user not called'`.
- Uses the same session restore pattern as `escalation_followup`:
  `getOrCreateV2Session(resumeSessionId)` preserves full conversation history.
- Same `runId` is reopened (`store.reopenRun()` resets status `error → running`)
  so the Activity Thread entry updates in-place (no duplicate entry).
- Sends only `"Continue."` as the initial message (no reminder — the user's
  intent is clear and context is already in the session).
- Resets the auto-continue counter to 0; the 10-retry loop runs again.
  This cycle repeats indefinitely until `report_to_user` is finally called.

**Rationale**:
- LLMs occasionally return `end_turn` prematurely due to model quirks, context
  issues, or non-deterministic behavior. In interactive sessions a human types
  "continue"; automation runs have no human operator.
- `report_to_user` is already mandated by the system prompt and powers the
  Activity Thread. Using it as the completion gate adds zero new concepts.
- `MAX_TURNS` raised from 30 → 100 to give autonomous runs more room before
  per-cycle turn limits are hit.

**Trade-off**: Up to 10 extra LLM round-trips per cycle in pathological cases,
plus indefinite user-driven cycles. Acceptable: the alternative is a silently
incomplete run with no recovery path.

### 2.12 App Chat Prompt Layering (Three-Layer Assembler)

**Decision**: The App chat system prompt is assembled from three ordered
layers — **Identity**, **Entry**, **Constraint** — by a channel-agnostic
assembler. Channel-specific content (IM session metadata, sender identity
rules, security rules) lives in the channel's module, not in the assembler.

```
src/main/apps/runtime/
├── prompt/
│   ├── assembler.ts        — assembleAppChatPrompt(fragments) — joins layers
│   ├── identity.ts         — buildIdentityFragments() — base + spec + memory + config
│   └── entry-native.ts     — NATIVE_CHAT_ENTRY — native UI fallback
└── im-channels/
    └── im-prompt.ts        — buildImEntry / buildImConstraints / ImSessionContext
```

**Layer responsibilities**:

| Layer | Answers | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Who am I, what do I do | Base Agent prompt, App spec, memory access, user config |
| Entry | Where am I, how do I reply | IM group/direct session context, native UI notification tools |
| Constraint | What I must not do | IM anti-impersonation rules when owners are configured |

**Rationale**:
- The previous flat builder kept growing channel-specific text every time a
  new entry point was added (IM bot, then native UI, then group vs direct
  variants). The file became a god-file that knew every channel.
- The assembler now only accepts pre-rendered string fragments and joins
  them with `\n\n---\n\n`. It never branches on channel.
- Adding a new entry channel (Feishu, Slack, voice, ...) requires one new
  builder file plus a one-line branch at the assembler call site in
  `app-chat.ts`. The assembler itself stays untouched.
- IM-specific knowledge lives in `im-channels/im-prompt.ts`, sibling to other
  IM concerns (provider impls, session registry, file-send MCP). Matches the
  hard rule "IM specifics live in im-channels".

**Single call site**: `app-chat.ts` is the only place that decides which
entry/constraint builder to invoke based on whether `imSession` is present.
The assembler call itself is one line:

```ts
const systemPrompt = assembleAppChatPrompt({ identity, entry, constraints })
```

**Trade-off**: One extra layer of indirection between `app-chat.ts` and the
final string. Acceptable: it caps the assembler's blast radius and prevents
the file from re-acquiring channel knowledge over time.
