## 1. Module Role

Pure data/persistence layer for App lifecycle management.
Consumed by `apps/runtime` (activation, status updates) and renderer (IPC for UI).
Does NOT execute Apps, trigger scheduling, or call Agents.

## 2. Key Design Decisions

### 2.1 State Machine for Status Transitions

**Decision**: Implement an explicit allow-list state machine rather than free-form status updates.

**Rationale**: Prevents illegal transitions (e.g., `error` -> `waiting_user` directly) which
would indicate bugs in `apps/runtime`. The state machine is small and well-defined:

```
          install()
             |
             v
         [active] <--------- resume()
           |   |                ^
   pause() |   | updateStatus() |
           v   v                |
       [paused] [error] --------+--- (via resume after fixing)
           |       |
           |       v
           |  [needs_login] ----+--- (via resume after re-login)
           |       |
           +-------+
                   |
                   v
           [waiting_user] ------+--- (via resolveEscalation -> active)
```

Valid transitions:
- `active` -> `paused`, `error`, `needs_login`, `waiting_user`
- `paused` -> `active`
- `error` -> `active`, `paused`
- `needs_login` -> `active`, `paused`
- `waiting_user` -> `active`, `paused`, `error`

Any other transition throws an `InvalidStatusTransitionError`.

### 2.2 pendingEscalationId -- Decoupled from runtime tables

**Decision**: Store `pendingEscalationId` as an opaque `string | null` rather than a FOREIGN KEY
to `activity_entries.id`.

**Rationale**: The architecture doc suggests this field points to `activity_entries.id`
(an `apps/runtime` table). Having a cross-module FK creates a tight coupling and circular
dependency between manager and runtime schemas. Instead:
- Manager stores it as a plain TEXT column with no FK constraint.
- Runtime is responsible for keeping it semantically valid.
- On uninstall, runtime cleans up its own tables (CASCADE on `app_id`).

### 2.3 Uninstall: Default Preserve, Optional Purge

**Decision**: `uninstall(appId, options?)` with `options.purge?: boolean` (default `false`).

**Rationale**: The architecture doc says "default preserve work directory". However, users
may want a clean uninstall. Adding `purge` as an opt-in flag satisfies both cases without
breaking the default contract. Runtime should call `deactivate(appId)` before uninstall.

### 2.4 userConfig Validation

**Decision**: Manager does NOT validate `userConfig` against `config_schema`.

**Rationale**:
- The caller (IPC layer or runtime) is responsible for validation before calling `updateConfig`.
- Manager is a data layer -- it persists what it is told.
- Validation logic belongs in the IPC handler or a shared utility, not in the persistence layer.
- This avoids coupling manager to the Zod schema details of `apps/spec`.

### 2.5 Space Isolation

**Decision**: `(spec_id, space_id)` together uniquely identify an installed App instance.
Different spaces can install the same spec independently with completely isolated state.

**Implementation**: The `id` (primary key) is a UUID generated at install time. The
`(spec_id, space_id)` pair has a UNIQUE constraint so you cannot install the same spec
twice in the same space. Different spaces produce different UUIDs, different rows, different
work directories.

### 2.6 Event Notification: Callback Array Pattern

**Decision**: Use a simple callback array pattern (not EventEmitter) for `onAppStatusChange`.

**Rationale**: Consistent with the project's existing pattern seen in:
- `platform/background` -- `onStatusChange` uses a handler array with unsubscribe function
- This is simpler and more explicit than Node.js EventEmitter for single-event patterns.

### 2.7 Migration Namespace

**Decision**: Use `'app_manager'` as the migration namespace.

**Rationale**: Consistent with the test example in `database-manager.test.ts` which already
uses `'app_manager'` as a namespace. Follows the underscore convention used by other modules.

### 2.8 App Work Directory Structure

```
{space.path}/.halo/apps/{appId}/          -- App root work directory
{space.path}/.halo/apps/{appId}/memory/   -- App memory directory
{space.path}/.halo/apps/{appId}/memory.md -- App memory file (created by memory module, not us)
```

`getAppWorkDir(appId)` returns the root. It ensures the directory exists (auto-creates).

### 2.9 updateStatus: Separate from pause/resume

**Decision**: Expose `updateStatus(appId, status, extra?)` as a general status setter
(used by runtime for `error`, `needs_login`, `waiting_user`), while `pause()` and `resume()`
are convenience wrappers that enforce specific transitions.

This keeps the interface clean:
- `pause(appId)` -- user action, only from `active`
- `resume(appId)` -- user action, from `paused`/`error`/`needs_login`
- `updateStatus(appId, status, extra)` -- runtime action, for `error`/`needs_login`/`waiting_user`

### 2.10 updateLastRun

**Decision**: Add `updateLastRun(appId, outcome, errorMessage?)` as a dedicated method
for runtime to record execution results. This is cleaner than overloading `updateStatus`.

### 2.11a Install Conflict — Skill vs Automation/MCP

**Decision**: `install()` overwrites an existing **active** skill of the same
`(specId, spaceId)` in place, but still rejects same-name `automation` /
`mcp` installs with `AppAlreadyInstalledError`.

**Rationale**: Skills are content-only artifacts — a prompt plus optional
files on disk — with no runtime state. Treating a re-install as an
overwrite matches how skill authors actually iterate: drop the same name
again with new content and expect the disk + DB to reflect the latest
version. Forcing an explicit uninstall first creates friction with zero
safety benefit.

Automation apps (and MCP apps) carry state the user does not want to
lose silently:

- `userConfig` values entered through the UI
- Runtime memory and run history
- Per-subscription `userOverrides` (schedule, frequency)
- Active sessions, pending escalations

Overwriting those silently would discard work the user did, so the
conflict gate still throws and the caller (UI / IPC / MCP tool) must
surface a clear message asking the user to uninstall or rename first.

**Uninstalled records** continue to follow the existing "soft-deleted →
reinstall on next install" path for both skills and apps — that branch
predates this decision and is unchanged.

### 2.11 Built-in Apps (VSCode-style bundled digital humans)

**Decision**: Bundle "built-in" digital humans with the build itself, install
them into the regular `installed_apps` table, and protect them from
permanent deletion. Mark them with `spec.store.install_source = 'builtin'`.

**Rationale**: Different product variants (open-source vs enterprise
variants) ship different default app sets. Hard-coding the spec content in
TypeScript would explode the source files and break maintainability; routing
through the App Store at first launch would require network connectivity. The
bundled-and-managed approach mirrors VSCode's built-in extension model:

- **Source of Truth** lives in an external repository per variant
  (e.g. `../digital-human-protocol-<variant>/packages/digital-humans/`), declared
  in `product.json` under the new `builtinApps` field.
- **Build-time sync**: `scripts/sync-builtin-apps.mjs` copies each declared
  app folder into `resources/builtin-apps/<specId>/` and writes a
  `manifest.json`. Runs automatically as a `prebuild` npm hook so any
  `npm run build` flow is covered. The destination is `.gitignore`d so the
  open-source repo never carries enterprise content.
- **Runtime loader**: `builtin-loader.ts` scans `resources/builtin-apps/` as
  a Tier-3 idle task, installs missing entries via the standard
  `appManager.install()` path (so all existing IPC, runtime, and analytics
  hooks just work), refreshes `spec_json` when the bundled version moves
  forward, and garbage-collects rows whose `specId` no longer appears in the
  manifest.
- **User state preservation**: `userConfig`, `userOverrides`, and `status`
  live in DB columns that the loader never touches when refreshing — only
  `spec_json` and `spec_id` are updated via `service.updateSpec`.
- **Disable semantics**: a "uninstall" on a built-in is a soft uninstall
  (status=`uninstalled`); the loader respects it across launches. Standard
  `reinstall` flow re-enables. This matches VSCode's per-user disable flag.
- **Hard-delete protection**: `service.deleteApp()` rejects built-ins with
  `BuiltinAppProtectedError` so a UI bug or curl call cannot wipe a built-in
  whose row would just respawn on next launch. The loader's GC sets a
  process-level bypass flag (`isBuiltinGcInProgress()`) when it legitimately
  needs to remove an obsolete built-in.

**Why not pure scanner / virtual entries?** A scanner-only design (no DB row,
merge in `listApps`/`getApp`) would have to rewrite ~40 caller sites across
IPC, runtime, services, and analytics — all of which currently assume a
single source of truth (the `installed_apps` table). The chosen design
achieves the same UX (auto-install, auto-upgrade, protected delete, user-
controlled disable) with zero changes to those callers.

**Performance**: The loader does N spec.yaml reads + N JSON parses per launch
(N = number of bundled apps, typically ≤10). For unchanged builds this is
~10–20ms total, all of which runs in the idle queue and never blocks the UI.

## 3. SQLite Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE installed_apps (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- UUID
  spec_id TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- App spec identifier
  space_id TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- Space this app belongs to
  spec_json TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Full AppSpec as JSON
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',  -- active|paused|error|needs_login|waiting_user
  pending_escalation_id TEXT,             -- Opaque ID (no FK, managed by runtime)
  user_config_json TEXT DEFAULT '{}',     -- User config values
  user_overrides_json TEXT DEFAULT '{}',  -- User overrides (frequency etc.)
  permissions_json TEXT DEFAULT '{"granted":[],"denied":[]}',
  installed_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_run_at INTEGER,
  last_run_outcome TEXT,                  -- 'useful'|'noop'|'error'|'skipped'|null
  error_message TEXT,
  UNIQUE(spec_id, space_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_installed_apps_space ON installed_apps(space_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_installed_apps_status ON installed_apps(status);
```

## 4. File Structure

```
src/main/apps/manager/
  index.ts            -- initAppManager(), shutdownAppManager(), re-exports
  types.ts            -- InstalledApp, AppManagerService, AppStatus, isBuiltinApp helper
  migrations.ts       -- Migration[] for the installed_apps table
  store.ts            -- SQLite CRUD operations (AppManagerStore class)
  service.ts          -- AppManagerService implementation (state machine, builtin guard)
  errors.ts           -- Custom error types (incl. BuiltinAppProtectedError)
  skill-sync.ts       -- Filesystem sync for skill apps (SDK-discoverable .md files)
  seed.ts             -- One-shot "Halo 助手" placeholder when no apps exist
  builtin-loader.ts   -- Built-in (bundled) digital human loader; runs as Tier-3 idle task
```

## 5. Interface Contract (what runtime depends on)

```typescript
interface AppManagerService {
  install(spaceId: string, spec: AppSpec, userConfig?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<string>
  uninstall(appId: string, options?: { purge?: boolean }): Promise<void>
  pause(appId: string): void
  resume(appId: string): void
  updateConfig(appId: string, config: Record<string, unknown>): void
  updateFrequency(appId: string, subscriptionId: string, frequency: string): void
  updateStatus(appId: string, status: AppStatus, extra?: { errorMessage?: string; pendingEscalationId?: string }): void
  updateLastRun(appId: string, outcome: RunOutcome, errorMessage?: string): void
  getApp(appId: string): InstalledApp | null
  listApps(filter?: AppListFilter): InstalledApp[]
  getAppWorkDir(appId: string): string
  clearAppMemory(appId: string): number
  grantPermission(appId: string, permission: string): void
  revokePermission(appId: string, permission: string): void
  onAppStatusChange(handler: StatusChangeHandler): Unsubscribe
}
```
