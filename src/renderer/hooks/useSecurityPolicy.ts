/**
 * useSecurityPolicy — renderer-side accessor for the build's security
 * policy flags.
 *
 * The policy is sourced from `product.json` in the main process and is
 * immutable for the lifetime of the process — there is no way to flip a
 * flag at runtime. The hook therefore:
 *
 *   1. Fetches once per renderer process and caches the result in a
 *      module-level promise so concurrent callers share a single round
 *      trip.
 *   2. Returns `null` while the first fetch is in flight. Consumers
 *      should treat `null` as "policy unknown — render the permissive
 *      default" (i.e. show the feature) so a brief network blip on the
 *      remote/web transport doesn't cause UI flashes that lock features
 *      that aren't actually disabled.
 *   3. Falls back to the permissive default when the fetch fails
 *      (e.g. older main process without the IPC). Failing closed would
 *      brick legitimate desktop builds during a partial upgrade.
 *
 * Anything stricter than "permissive default on read failure" must be
 * enforced server-side — the renderer-side gate is a UX layer, not a
 * security boundary.
