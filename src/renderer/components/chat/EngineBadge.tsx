/**
 * EngineBadge
 *
 * Subtle inline marker that tells the user which agent engine
 * ("Claude Code", "Halo SDK", "Codex") owns a conversation.
 *
 * Visual treatment is intentionally low-key — light/translucent colored text,
 * no fill, no border — so the badge informs without competing with the
 * conversation title for attention. Hover the badge to see the full engine
 * name in the tooltip.
 *
 * This is the ONLY place in the renderer that's allowed to read an engine
 * id directly. Every other component branches on capability flags via
 * `useEngineCapabilities()` to stay engine-agnostic.
 *
 * Renders nothing for the default ('anthropic') engine to avoid badge
 * clutter on existing CC users — the UX promise is zero disruption for them.
 * Codex / Halo SDK conversations show the badge.
